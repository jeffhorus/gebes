<h1>About Brodo</h1>
Back in 2010, two college guys, Yukka and Putra thought to build a business but they couldn't figure what should they sell. It started when Yukka needed a pair of dress shoes to accompany his final assignment presentation but it was really hard to find his shoe size, which was 46. While he could fit the size, it was hard to fit the price. Then the idea of starting a business came up: to make shoes that fit in style yet affordable.
